# Salesforce Rest Api Client

A basic Salesforce Api client for PHP, based on [bjsmasth/php-salesforce-rest-api](https://github.com/bjsmasth/php-salesforce-rest-api).

Supports basic Api methods, SOQL query templating, and mapping of Salesforce records to PHP objects.

## Requirements

Requires php 7.4, or php 8.

## Installation

Install using [composer](https://getcomposer.org): `composer require nexcess/salesforce`

## Getting Started

### Setting up a Connected App

Before you begin, you need to have set up a "Connected App" in Salesforce and get a `consumerKey`, `consumerSecret`, `username`, and `password` to allow Api access.

_Note, this process may vary depending on changes to the Salesforce website, or on your Salesforce account and settings._

_Check [Salesforce's Help Docs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm) to verify._

1. Log into to your Salesforce org
2. Click on Setup in the upper right-hand menu
3. Under Build click Create → Apps
4. Scroll to the bottom and click "New" under Connected Apps.
5. Enter the following details for the remote application:
    - Connected App Name
    - API Name
    - Contact Email
    - Under the API dropdown, enable OAuth Settings
    - Callback URL
    - Select Access Scope (If you need a refresh token, specify it here)
6. Click Save, and store your access credentials in a safe place.

### Basic Usage

Creating a new Api client and connecting:
```php
use Nexcess\Salesforce {
  Authentication\Password,
  Client
};

// if you need to use a different login endpoint than the default `login.salesforce.com`
//  (e.g., for a sandbox installation during development),
//  include it here with your credentials using the "endpoint" key.
$salesforce = new Client(
    (new Password())->authenticate([
        "client_id" => $YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY,
        "client_secret" => $YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET,
        "username" => $YOUR_SALESFORCE_USERNAME,
        "password" => $YOUR_SALESFORCE_PASSWORD_AND_SECURITY_TOKEN
    ])
);
```

The following examples use a Salesforce object named `Example` that has a field `Name`.

Executing Basic SOQL Queries:
```php
$select = "SELECT Id, Name FROM Example LIMIT 100";
foreach ($salesforce->query($select) as $object) {
    echo "Example {$object->Id} ({$object->Name})\n";
    // outputs something like "Example 5003000000D8cuIQAA (Bob)"
}
```

If you need to use php values in your query, put `{tokens}` in your SOQL and pass the values separately via `query()`'s second argument. The values will be properly quoted and escaped based on their type, and interpolated into the query:
```php
$select = "SELECT Id, Name FROM Example WHERE Name={name} LIMIT 100";
$name = 'Bob';
foreach ($salesforce->query($select, ['name' => $name]) as $object) {
    echo "Example {$object->Id} ({$object->Name})\n";
    // outputs something like "Example 5003000000D8cuIQAA (Bob)"
}
```

Fetching a Record by Id:
```php
$id = "5003000000D8cuIQAA";
$bob = $salesforce->get("Example", $id);
echo "Hello, {$bob->Name}\n";
// outputs something like "Hello, Bob"
```

Creating a new Record:
```php
use Nexcess\Salesforce\SalesforceObject;

$linda = $salesforce->create(new SalesforceObject("Example", ["Name" => "Linda"]));
echo "Example {$linda->Id} ({$linda->Name})";
// outputs something like "Example 5003000000D8cuIQAA (Linda)"
```

Updating an existing Record:
```php
$bob->Name = "Roberto";
$roberto = $salesforce->update($bob);
echo "Hello, {$roberto->Name}\n";
// outputs "Hello, Roberto"
```

Deleting a Record:
```php
$ded = $salesforce->delete($bob);
var_dump($ded->Id);
// outputs "NULL"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Salesforce Object Classes

The included `Nexcess\Salesforce\SaleforceObject` class can be used without modification as a generic "salesforce record" implementation - it will automatically set properties based on what's fetched from the Api. However, the intent is that applications will extend from it and define the properties needed for each of their Salesforce objects. This allows for a consistent schema that your code can rely on, and even lets you implement some level of validation directly in your application.

To build your own Salesforce Object, you must:
- extend from `Nexcess\Salesforce\SalesforceObject`
- define the object fields as public properties
- add any necessary logic in `setField()` (e.g., building a new object if your record has a relation)
- add any desired logic in `validateField()`

Using our "Example" object from above,
```php
use Nexcess\Salesforce\SalesforceObject;

class Example extends SalesforceObject {

    public ? string $Name = null;
}
```

### Field Validation

Some basic validation functions are included in `Nexcess\Salesforce\Validator`. These methods all take the value to validate as the first argument, and can have other arguments depending on needs. Follow this same pattern to implement additional validation functions for your own objects as needed.
```php
use Nexcess\Salesforce\ {
    SalesforceObject,
    Validator
};

class Example extends SalesforceObject {

    public ? string $Name = null;

    protected function validateField(string $field) : void {
        switch ($field) {
            case "Name":
                Validator::characterLength($this->Name, 2, 100);
                return;
            default:
                parent::validateField($field);
                return;
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling Errors

All Runtime Exceptions thrown from this library will be an instance of `Nexcess\Salesforce\Error`.

Exceptions are grouped into the following types:
- `Nexcess\Salesforce\Error\Salesforce`:

    Errors originating from the Salesforce API, including HTTP errors (e.g., connection timeouts)
- `Nexcess\Salesforce\Error\Authentication`:

    Authentication failures or attempts to use the HttpClient before authentication has succeeded
- `Nexcess\Salesforce\Error\Result`:

    Errors parsing or handling Salesforce Api results or records; these will usually indicate a problem in your custom SalesforceObject classes
- `Nexcess\Salesforce\Error\Usage`:

    Errors arising from incorrect library usage; these will usually indicate a runtime problem in your application code
- `Nexcess\Salesforce\Error\Validation`:

    Validation errors.
